# Welcome
Welcome to my personal website! I like to write software! Go is currently my language of choice for back-end development, but I'm currently working my way into Rust. I can also do front-end work if required using a bit of JavaScript and Vue.

# Code
The code I work on is primarily hosted on GitHub for now, but once I implement a robust backup strategy for my Gitea instance, I plan to make use of it much more.
